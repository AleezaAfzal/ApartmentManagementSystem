# Apartment Management System

> 🚧 Work in Progress

This project is an Apartment Management System built with .NET 8. It helps tenants and owners manage apartments efficiently. The system is still under development, adding extra functionalities and improving my programming and software development skills.

## Description
This system allows tenants and owners to interact with apartment-related services.  

Guests can browse and search apartments for rent on the website.  
To book a visit, guests must sign up and create an account.  
Once signed up and approved, users become tenants and can log into the tenant portal to access additional features.  
Owners have their own portal to manage buildings, apartments, services, bills, and tenant complaints.
